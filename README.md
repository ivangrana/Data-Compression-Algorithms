# Data-Compression-Algorithms

## About:

<div>
This repository is a collection of various compression algorithms implemented in different programming languages such as C++, Rust and Python. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or enthusiast, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding and implementing compression techniques.

## Algorithms

### Huffman Coding

Huffman coding is a widely used entropy encoding algorithm that creates variable-length codes for data based on the frequency of each symbol. The more frequent the symbol, the shorter its code.

### Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)

LZW is a dictionary-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated sequences of characters with shorter codes. It is commonly used in GIF and TIFF image formats.

### Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

RLE is a simple compression algorithm that replaces sequences of identical elements with a single value and a count. It is efficient for compressing data with long runs of the same value.

### Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)

BWT is a reversible transformation that rearranges characters to make data more amenable to compression. It is often used as a preprocessing step in conjunction with other compression algorithms.

## Usage

Each algorithm has its dedicated folder containing implementation files and examples in various programming languages. To use a specific algorithm, navigate to its folder and follow the instructions in the README file.
